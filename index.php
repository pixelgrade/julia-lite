 * The main template file.
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme
 * and one of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query.
 * E.g., it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.

/**
 * =========================
 * A few (wise) words
 *
 * For consistency amongst our themes, we have put as much of the theme behaviour (both logical and stylistic)
 * in components (the `components` directory). This includes the "classic" theme files like `archive.php`, `single.php`,
 * `header.php`, or `sidebar.php`.
 * Do not worry! You can still have those files in a theme's root folder, or in directories like template-parts, or a child theme.
 * It will automagically work!
 *
 * We prefer not to use those files if the theme design allows us to stick to the markup patterns common to our themes,
 * available in our components.
 * This will make for more solid themes, faster update cycles and faster development for new themes.
 *
 * Now, let the show begin!
 * Oh snap... it already began :)
